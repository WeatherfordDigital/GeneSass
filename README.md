2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the Genesis Sample theme ( GeneSass ).
4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.

You are free to use any compiler like Compass, Gulp, Grunt or Sass. As an example I put a Compass config file in the repo.

The SCSS files of the GeneSass Theme are linted and rewritten in proper scss.
